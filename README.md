The objective of Spider Solitaire is to arrange the given decks of cards in sets of descending order, from King to Ace, within each of the game's ten columns. As you progress, the challenge intensifies with the introduction of more cards and fewer available moves. By strategically maneuvering the cards, players aim to clear the entire deck, and in doing so, win the game.
